1. **Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs):** These are models trained on vast amounts of data that can generate content approximating human abilities.

2. **Generative AI:** This is a subset of traditional machine learning where AI creates content that mimics human-generated content. It does this by identifying statistical patterns from large datasets.

3. **Training of LLMs:** LLMs have been trained on trillions of words, requiring immense computational power over long durations.

4. **Foundation Models:** Also known as base models, these are massive models with billions of parameters. Parameters are like the model's memory. The more parameters, the more intricate tasks the model can execute.

5. **Representation:** In this course, LLMs are represented by purple circles. An example of an open-source model is flan-T5.

6. **Fine-tuning:** Instead of training models from scratch, one can adjust foundation models to a specific use case, thereby creating custom solutions swiftly.

7. **Course Focus:** While there are generative models for various media (images, video, etc.), this course concentrates on LLMs and their applications in natural language generation.

8. **Interaction with LLMs:** Unlike traditional programming, where one uses specific syntax, LLMs understand and operate on natural language. The text passed to an LLM is referred to as a "prompt."

9. **Context Window:** This is the available memory space for a prompt, generally sufficient for a few thousand words, although it varies per model.

10. **Prompts and Completions:** When you provide an LLM with a prompt, it predicts the next set of words, leading to an "inference." The resultant text is called a "completion."

11. **Example:** The lecture presented an instance where an LLM was questioned about Ganymede's location. The model successfully identified Ganymede as a moon of Jupiter and provided a coherent response.

Throughout the course, participants will explore several such examples, detailing the process of prompting and obtaining completions from the models.
